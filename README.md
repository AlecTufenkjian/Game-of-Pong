# Game-of-Pong
This project is an implementation of the Game of Pong with ACM library and Java. In short, a player and a computer agent simulate the game of ping-pong on a computer display. Please [click here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o-fLpt_NP-kez8d8Di9EEEvjbaRlboCzq8WCicgSFbE/edit?usp=sharing) to quickly see what it looks like.

I have simulated in this game a moderately complex physics engine. It simulates Newton's equations of motion, allowing me to calculate the position and velocity of
a simulated pong-pong ball as a function of time. It takes account of gravity, energy loss on collisions, energy gain on hits, as well as air resistance. All of this, while the computer time is synchronized with our real-world time.

Adjusting the pace of the game and the computer agent's lag, the agent can be extremely strong. If you're up for a challenge, give it a try!
